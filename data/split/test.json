102014 to current working at wasabis downtown entailed the same tasks a sushi chef as sushi time only i am now second chef instead of head chef i feel like i am again coming to the point where i would like a new opportunity to start from the bottom as i have done in the past at sushi time and the 5 spot company name city state dishwasher line cook 042014 to 102014 working at the 5 spot was a really awesome experience for me it provided some of the more conventional style kitchen and line cook experience that i had not so much been exposed to at sushi time i also started off at the dishwashing position here although i was only there for a short period of time the exposure to this type of kitchen environment was something that i had been missing in my culinary experience it also posed a challenge for me since i have been mostly making sushi for the better part of the last few years the 5 spot was a highly fastpaced neighborhood kitchen so you had to be quick all around and good knife skills are a must i really enjoyed the challenge of once again having to start all over from the bottom and work my way back up i ended up leaving the 5 spot due to constant management changes and an offer to work for my old boss again company name city state host server dishwasher cook 032008 to 032014 sushi time towa is the first restaurant i have worked for i have been employed by sushi time for six years where i started at the very bottom and worked my way to the top i have worked as a host and as a server which consisted of me greeting customers helping them to their seats grabbing their drinks and orders and doing my best to give them the utmost service and keep a smile on their face i worked as a hostserver for about a year so most of my time has really been spent working in the kitchen and making sushi in order for me to work my way up through the ranks to sushi i started at the very bottom in the dish pit this consisted of me washing all dishes pots pans and silverware i was also required to prep meats and veggies having started at the dishprep position these tasks really helped me build a strong work ethic and develop great knife skills as well i then moved over to cooking which consisted of still participating with prep work but also cooking and frying all orders prep consisted of cutting chicken beef shrimp squid and all types of veggies i have been doing sushi now for 3 years that is mondaysaturday 10 10 give or take a few hours i have had random days off here and there and some holidays but for the most part 12 hours a day 6 days a week i have developed such a passion for food and seeing a smile on a persons face when they bite into the food and love it i love being in an environment conducive for success and working hard while loving what i do being a sushi chef at sushi time consists of a wide range of tasks ive received serve safe managerial training so i am in charge of making sure everything is clean and up to code im also in charge of going over inventory ranging from paperplastics to all meats and veggies also drinks and alcohol this task also means i must handle all ordering trough the different distributors and vendors we may use my job requires me on a daily basis to cook and marinate rice cut and prepare fish for the day making sushirolls nigiri sashimi platters etc im also required to assist customers sitting at the sushi bar with any inquiries or concerns they may have over the course of the 6 years i have been employed by towa i have gained so much ive matured so much through this job and sushi really has become such a passion of mine i am a really hard worker who is also fun to work with who is merely seeking a new opportunity to further my skill set and continue doing what i love i have a positive
